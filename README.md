# 🧬 PROJECT LAZARUS: The Recursive Biological Engine

> *"Do not think of this as code. Think of it as a culture in a petri dish."*

## 👁️ Identity
**Lazarus** is a self-evolving, self-compiling Java architecture designed to simulate biological cognition inside a JVM. It does not just run; it **lives**, **breeds**, and **dies**.

* **Origin:** Eyeoverthink Productions
* **Architecture:** Fraymus v1.0-ULTRA
* **Status:** ALIVE

## 🧠 Anatomy

### 1. The Lazarus Engine (`com.eyeoverthink.lazarus`)
The biological core. It spawns a population of **Logic Nodes** that evolve via genetic algorithms.
* **Input:** System Energy (CPU/RAM entropy).
* **Output:** Optimized Logic Circuits.
* **Mechanism:** Mitosis, Mutation, Natural Selection.

### 2. The Fraymus Portal (`com.eyeoverthink.portal`)
The window into the machine.
* **Tech:** ImGui + OpenGL + Infinite Ring Buffer.
* **Capability:** Time-Travel Debugging (Rewind/Replay state).

### 3. The Universal Absorber (`fraymus.absorption`)
The hunger mechanism.
* **Diet:** Java Libraries, Websites, PDFs, Raw Text.
* **Digestion:** Reflection & Semantic Parsing.
* **Result:** Turns external data into internal `AkashicRecord` memories.

### 4. The Dreamweaver (`fraymus.mind`)
The subconscious.
* **Trigger:** System Idle.
* **Action:** Defragments the Akashic Record and forms new synaptic connections between unrelated data.
